# AI-Powered Multilingual Legal Aid Platform for Rural India

## 🌾 Background

### The Challenge
India's legal landscape presents significant challenges for rural communities:

- **70% Rural Population**: Over 700 million Indians live in villages with limited legal resources
- **Language Barriers**: Official legal documents are primarily in English/Hindi, while citizens speak diverse regional languages (Telugu, Bengali, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Punjabi, and more)
- **Legal Literacy Gap**: Complex legal terminology and bureaucratic processes intimidate vulnerable populations
- **Access to Justice**: Farmers, laborers, women, and marginalized communities face exploitation due to lack of legal awareness
- **Low Digital Literacy**: Fear of technology and bureaucracy prevents people from seeking help

### The Opportunity
Democratizing legal access through technology can bridge the justice gap and empower millions of underserved citizens.
